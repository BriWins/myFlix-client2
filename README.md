# Flix It Up Application

The **Flix It Up** application provides registered users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users can register an account, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. 

## Objective

This repository is a successor of  [Flix It Up server side component](https://github.com/BriWins/MyFlix.git). Using React, Flix It Up client-side is based on its existing REST API and database. The interface makes requests to and receives responses from the server-side. It includes several interface views built using the React library that handles data through the previously-defined REST API endpoints.
